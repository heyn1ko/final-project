## FINAL PROJECT | INDEX

<h2>Index is a platform for the independent art spaces in Vienna. Each space can create their own profile where they can add their exhibitions and/or events. The project aims to be a public database for anyone who wishes to check the events in Vienna.
At the same time the platform is structured in a way to include people with disabilities but also the app itself is an ongoing project for me to expand my knowledge in digital a11y.</h2>
