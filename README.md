Index is a platform for the independent art spaces in Vienna. Each space can create their own profile, add exhibition and events. The project aims to be a database for anyone to come and check the art events in the city in these spaces and also invites the spaces to re-think how their premises function and furthermore opens a conversation on the role of art in our society
